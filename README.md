# challenge2

#### Make an application which stores names and email addresses in a database (SQLite is fine). Make sure it:

1. Has welcome page in http://localhost/ 
2. Note: this page has links to list and create functions
3. Lists all stored names/email address in (http://localhost/list)
4. Adds a name/email address to the database in (http://localhost/add) 
*Note: should validate input and show errors*

*The challenge is a Django based application, so please make sure you use all of Django infrastructure (form, template inheritance, ORM) correctly. Also make sure the app does not have major security problems: CSRF, XSS, SQL Injection.*
